Iris Flower Classfication
Utilizing machine learning techniques, I trained a model to distinguish between the three species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on their distinct measurements.
While the Scikit-learn library offers a standard dataset for this classification, I opted to enhance my learning by sourcing the data independently.
